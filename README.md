```

## Installation
```pip install ocralign```

## Usage example
```
from ocralign import process_pdf, process_image

# OCR a single image
print(process_image("./sample.png"))

# OCR a multi-page PDF (returns list of text per page)
texts = process_pdf("./images-pdf.pdf", dpi=300)

# OCR a PDF and write result to a file
process_pdf("./images-pdf.pdf", dpi=300, output_path="test.txt")
```
